📖 About The Project

AlgoViz is a modern, high-performance visualization playground designed to make learning computer science algorithms intuitive and engaging.

Built with React, Vite, and Framer Motion, it moves away from clunky, old-school visualizers, offering instead a smooth, "neon cyber" aesthetic. It visually explains fundamental sorting and searching algorithms through animated elements, step-by-step comparisons, and cinematic highlights.

Target Audience: Students, educators, and developers looking for a clean, browser-native educational tool.

🌟 Features

🎨 Visual & Interactive

Neon Cyber Aesthetic: A futuristic, dark-mode-first UI built with Tailwind CSS.

Smooth Animations: Powered by Framer Motion for buttery smooth element transitions.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

⚡ Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort: Visualize the bubbling effect of elements.

Selection Sort: Track the minimum value selection process.

Insertion Sort: Watch how arrays are built one item at a time.

Binary Search: Interactive pointer tracking for O(log n) lookups.

🛠 Educational Tools (WIP)

Step-by-Step Mode: Pause and step through algorithms manually.

Narrated Explanations: Browser-native Text-to-Speech integration (Web Speech API).

🧠 Technologies Used

This project relies on a modern, lightweight, and completely free tech stack. No paid APIs are used.
