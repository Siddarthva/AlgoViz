## 📖 About The Project
AlgoViz is a modern visualization playground built to help learners understand classic computer science algorithms through **step-by-step animations**.  

Instead of static diagrams, AlgoViz shows how each algorithm thinks and moves — making CS concepts feel alive.  

> Designed to be fast, clean, and fun — without requiring backend services or paid APIs.
